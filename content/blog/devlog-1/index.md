## Welcome to the first devlog of Left Stranded!

I decided to start a devlog to keep track of my progress on the game but also to keep you guys up to speed about whatever I will be working on. I will try to consistently post new devlogs every couple of weeks, I think it would be a good time frame to be able to present somethibg compelling and hopefully interesting!
